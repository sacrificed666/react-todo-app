# 🏷️ Releases

Tasks uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The version lives in `package.json`, the footer shows it with a link to the changelog, and every release is described in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) in the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. The current version is **1.0.0**.

## 🔢 Version numbers

| Part     | Changes when                                                                                                                                            | Example |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 🔴 Major | Something people rely on stops working: a removed feature, saved tasks or an export that a new version cannot read, an address that changes its meaning | `2.0.0` |
| 🟡 Minor | A new feature or a visible improvement that keeps everything else working                                                                               | `1.1.0` |
| 🟢 Patch | Bug fixes, security fixes, dependency updates and text corrections                                                                                      | `1.0.1` |

> [!TIP]
> The commit types point at the next version: a `feat` calls for a minor release, a `fix` for a patch, and a `!` after the type (`feat!: …`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for a major one.

| Branch               | Purpose                                                          | Deploys to              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 🌱 `development`     | Finished work comes together here; every pull request targets it | 🧪 Development preview  |
| 🧪 `staging`         | The next release, checked as a whole before it reaches people    | 🔍 Staging              |
| 🚀 `main`            | Released code only; every merge into it is tagged with a version | 🌍 Production           |
| 🌿 `feat/…`, `fix/…` | One change, branched from `development`                          | 👀 Pull request preview |

## 🚀 Cutting a release

1. 🔢 On `development`, pick the version from the notes under **Unreleased** and bump it without a tag:

   ```bash
   npm version minor --no-git-tag-version
   ```

2. 📝 In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename **Unreleased** to `## [1.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`, add an empty **Unreleased** section above it and update the comparison links at the bottom.
3. 📬 Commit as `chore(release): v1.1.0` and open a pull request from `development` into `staging`. Check the staging build in a few languages, on a phone, offline and in both themes.
4. 🔀 Open a pull request from `staging` into `main` and merge it.
5. 🏷️ Tag the merge on `main` and push the tag:

   ```bash
   git switch main && git pull
   git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "v1.1.0"
   git push origin v1.1.0
   ```

6. 🤖 The release workflow publishes the GitHub release with the notes of that version from `CHANGELOG.md`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The tag must equal `v` plus the version in `package.json` and point at a commit on `main`. Otherwise the release workflow fails before anything is published.

## 🩹 Hotfixes

An urgent fix does not wait for `development`:

1. 🌿 Branch `fix/…` from `main`, fix the problem and bump the patch version (`npm version patch --no-git-tag-version`).
2. 📝 Add the `## [1.0.1] - YYYY-MM-DD` section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. 🔀 Merge the pull request into `main`, then tag and push `v1.0.1` as above.
4. ↩️ Merge `main` back into `staging` and `development`, so the fix is not lost in the next release.

## 🤖 Automation

| Where                                  | What it checks                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 CI on every push and pull request   | `scripts/release-notes.mjs` finds a non-empty `CHANGELOG.md` section for the version in `package.json`                                |
| 🏷️ `release.yml` on every `v*.*.*` tag | The tag matches `package.json`, the commit is on `main`, then `gh release create` publishes the release with the notes of the version |
| 🤖 Dependabot every Monday             | Opens its pull requests against `development`, so updates ship with the next release                                                  |

Run `node scripts/release-notes.mjs` locally to see the notes of the current version, or `node scripts/release-notes.mjs v1.1.0` to check a tag before pushing it.

## ⚙️ One-time GitHub setup

1. Create the `development` and `staging` branches from `main` and make `development` the default branch, so new pull requests target it.
2. Protect `main` and `staging` under **Settings → Rules**: require a pull request and the `verify`, `build` and `e2e` checks, and block force pushes.
3. Optionally add a tag rule for `v*`, so only maintainers can create releases.

## ☁️ Environments

GitHub Pages serves one site per repository, so only `main` is published there. Every push to `staging` or `development` runs the full CI and uploads the built site as the `site-staging` or `site-development` artifact of the run, kept for 14 days.

| Environment    | Branch        | Where                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌍 Production  | `main`        | [GitHub Pages](https://sacrificed666.github.io/react-todo-app/) |
| 🔍 Staging     | `staging`     | The `site-staging` artifact of the CI run                       |
| 🧪 Development | `development` | The `site-development` artifact of the CI run                   |

To try a staging build, download the artifact, unpack it into `dist/` and run `npm run preview`.

> [!NOTE]
> A staging build keeps the production base path `/react-todo-app/` and its own service worker. Open it in a private window, so it does not share the service worker or the saved tasks of the production site.

Outside GitHub Pages, the same three environments run in Docker: `docker/development.yaml` starts the dev server, and `docker/staging.yaml` and `docker/production.yaml` serve the production build with nginx, where only production may be indexed, see [Deployment](./deployment.md#-docker).
