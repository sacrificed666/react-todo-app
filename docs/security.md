# 🛡️ Security

Todo App is a static, local-first web app: no backend, no accounts, no cookies, no analytics and no requests to other origins, not even for the language flags. That removes whole classes of problems, but the browser still handles untrusted data (imported files, shared content, URL parameters and data written by other tabs), so the app treats all of it as hostile until validated.

To report a vulnerability, follow the [security policy](../.github/SECURITY.md).

## 🧱 Content Security Policy

GitHub Pages cannot send custom headers, so the production build injects a CSP `<meta>` tag as the very first element of `<head>` (the `security-headers` plugin in `vite.config.ts`). The development server stays without it because Vite's hot reload relies on inline scripts.

A `referrer` meta tag sets `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and external links use `rel="noreferrer"`.

The only `<script>` without a `src` in `index.html` is the `application/ld+json` block with structured data for search engines. Browsers treat it as data and never run it, so it needs no exception in the policy; the build report allows exactly this type and fails on any other inline script.

## 🛂 Trusted Types

With Trusted Types enforced, assigning a string to a dangerous DOM sink such as `innerHTML`, `script.src` or `ServiceWorkerContainer.register()` throws. The app never needs HTML strings: React renders every title and note as text.

The only sink in use is the service worker registration. `shared/lib/trustedTypes.ts` installs a `default` policy that allows exactly one URL, the app's own `sw.js` on the same origin, and rejects everything else:

```ts
installScriptUrlPolicy([`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}sw.js`]);
```

`scripts/build-report.mjs` checks on every CI run that the built `index.html` still contains the policy, enforces Trusted Types and has no inline scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> The end-to-end test `e2e/security.spec.ts` proves the same in a real browser: a session of adding tasks, opening the settings and the palette produces no console errors and no `securitypolicyviolation` events, and assigning HTML to `innerHTML` throws a `TypeError`.

## ✅ Input validation

| 🔗 URL parameters          | Only `list`, `action`, `title`, `text` and `url` are read; they become plain text and are removed from the address bar                                                             |
| 🎨 Preferences             | Every value is checked against the allowed appearances, accents, backgrounds, glass styles, languages, effects and sort orders; a saved project view must name an existing project |

Objects are rebuilt field by field, so unknown properties, including `__proto__`, never reach the store.

## 🏳️ Flag images

The language picker shows flags from `public/flags/`, copied from the `country-flag-icons` package by `npm run flags`, so no third-party origin is involved.

- 🖼️ They are plain `<img>` elements (an SVG loaded as an image cannot run scripts or reach the page), and the CSP allows nothing else from that origin.
- 🕵️ `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` keeps the app's address out of the requests, and nothing about your tasks is ever sent.
- 💤 `loading="lazy"` inside closed menus means no request is made until the settings or the palette's language commands are opened; the service worker then serves them from its `flags` cache.

## 🗄️ Data on the device

- 💾 Tasks, projects and preferences live in `localStorage` of the site's origin and never leave the device.
- ⬅️ The history entries that let **Back** close sheets carry only a random marker, never task data, and are removed when the sheet closes.
- 🧹 Clearing the site data in the browser removes everything; the error screen offers **Download a backup** first.
- 🔄 The service worker only caches the app's own files and asks before activating an update.

- 📦 `npm ci` installs exactly what `package-lock.json` describes, and `npm audit signatures` verifies the registry signatures and provenance attestations of every package.
- 🛡️ The dependency review action blocks pull requests that add dependencies with high-severity advisories.
- 🔬 CodeQL scans the TypeScript code and the workflow files with the `security-extended` queries on every push, pull request and weekly.
- 🔐 Workflows run with a read-only token, checkouts do not persist credentials, and only the deploy job may write to Pages.
- 🤖 Dependabot proposes npm and GitHub Actions updates every week.
- 🧾 npm runs dependency install scripts only for packages approved in `allowScripts` in `package.json`; the two that exist (`@parcel/watcher` and `fsevents`, both shipping prebuilt binaries) are denied.

## ☑️ Checklist for contributors

> [!CAUTION]
> Trusted Types make any HTML string assignment throw at runtime, in production only. Test new DOM code with `npm run test:e2e`, which runs the production build.

- [ ] Never render user content with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or assign HTML strings to the DOM.
- [ ] Route every new kind of input through a parser that rebuilds the data and caps its size.
- [ ] Do not add requests to other origins; if one is unavoidable, extend the CSP as narrowly as possible (one origin, one directive) and explain why in the pull request.
- [ ] Keep workflow permissions minimal and pass `persist-credentials: false` to new checkouts.
